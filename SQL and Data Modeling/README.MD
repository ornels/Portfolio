A business that controls or stores data is in dire need of a database management system to properly store, process, and manage information. Organizing these systems requires strategic thinking and accurate predictions with regards to our users’ needs and business demands. Here, we will build a database management system (DBMS) for a stock exchange brokerage who’s responsible for the trade of stocks, historical data of stocks, and the financial investments of users. To achieve this, we will use a relational database system, this will allow us to decrease data redundancy by relating our data our data to relate to other data via unique primary and foreign keys. Within the context of our business, we must prioritize consistency and integrity, two advantages are usually covered in a relational database management system (Sumathi & Esakkirajan, 2007). Our database utilizes a structured query language (SQL) software and it will allow us to communicate, modulate, and retrieve data. Finally, we will analyze the efficiency scalability and functionality of our database with relation to the ACID properties, and CAP theorem.
