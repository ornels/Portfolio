Project Title: Predicting DVD Rental Duration for Inventory Planning

A DVD rental company has enlisted my expertise to tackle a crucial challenge: predicting the duration of DVD rentals based on various customer-related features. The primary objective is to develop regression models capable of accurately forecasting the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for, with the company setting a strict requirement of achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3 or less on a dedicated test set. This predictive model holds the potential to revolutionize the company's inventory planning processes, allowing for more efficient allocation of resources and inventory management. Through the application of advanced regression techniques and feature engineering, this project aims to empower the DVD rental company with the predictive insights essential for optimizing their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
